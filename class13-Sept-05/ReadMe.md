## Question 1
Create a **bicycle** class
- Build a list for 6 bikes
- Accelerate the bicycles in the odd elements (1,3,5)
- Print out the status of each bicycle referenced in that list

 ## Question 2
 Implement the class Position that represents a coordinate (x, y). Each position is defined by two integer values ​​x and y. Available operations are:
* Default constructor, corresponds to the position (0,0). 
* Constructor with initial values ​​of X and Y 
* Methods for modifying and querying (set / get) the attributes of the class. 
* Methods for increasing and decreasing the values ​​of each of the position coordinates (incX, incY, decX, decY). 
* A method for setting coordinate values ​​(setXY).

Bonus: Have an internal list of previously visited positions that can be printed
